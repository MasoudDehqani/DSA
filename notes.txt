Main operations on a data structure:
- read
- search
- insertion
- deletion

Categories of time complexityies in terms of Big O:
- O(1) -> constatnt time
- O(n) -> linear time
- O(log n) -> logarithmic time

- array VS set -> only differs on insertion

- The whole beauty of binary search is that each inspection eliminates half of the remaining elements. Therefore, each time we double the amount
of data, we add only one step

Logarithm
- inverse of exponentiation
- how many times the base needs to be multiplied by itself to reach the number specified in front of log
- what exponent the base should be raised to reach the number specified in front of log
- how many times the number specified in front of log should be divided by the base to reach 1
